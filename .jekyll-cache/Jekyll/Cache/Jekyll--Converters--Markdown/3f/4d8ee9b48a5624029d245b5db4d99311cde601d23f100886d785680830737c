I"ˆ<p>A generate-and-test algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their usefulness. In this process, features useful to the agent performance on the task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly generated features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on two online multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses on the agentâ€™s ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn patterns in the observations and remember them for a future prediction.</p>
