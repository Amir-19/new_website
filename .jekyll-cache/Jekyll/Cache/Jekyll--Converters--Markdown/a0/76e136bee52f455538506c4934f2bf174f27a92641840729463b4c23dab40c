I"D<p>We propose two methods for learning the agent state online based on the generate-and-test approach.
We study the proposed methods on two online multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses on the
agentâ€™s ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into the future.
In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn patterns in the
observation signals and remember them for future predictions. We show that our
proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online and produce accurate
predictions.</p>
